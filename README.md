# BinBot / BinCompanion

##Introduction

BinBot is an autonomous robot trash bin capable of monitoring how much trash is put in it and saving people’s time by travelling on its own to be dumped. Bin bot is designed to help avoid the problem of trash bins in open areas from being overfilled and left unattended. It also is meant to help save employee’s time so they can do other things.  The robot is intended to be operated in public areas such as office buildings, libraries and hospitals.

This project was created for Final Year capstone project while I was in McMaster University 2017-2018
